## Binary Classification with MC-Dropout Models

An introduction to classification with Bayesian Deep Learning with the Monte-Carlo Dropout implementation.  

### Introduction

Uncertainty measurement for Deep Learning models may play an important role in the context of risk management. Still, to understand the mechanism and interpretation of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, we first analyze them in a simpler and risk-less context, the **cats vs. dogs image classification.**
